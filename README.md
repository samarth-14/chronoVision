## **🛠️ Built With**

This project leverages modern web technologies to deliver a fast, scalable, and feature-rich experience.

**Frontend:**

* [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) \- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
* [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) \- Statically typed superset of JavaScript.  
* [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/) \- Next-generation frontend tooling for a blazing-fast development experience.  
* [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) \- A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.  
* [**Shadcn/ui**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) \- A collection of beautifully designed, accessible UI components.

**Backend & Deployment:**

* [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/) \- Used for:  
  * **Hosting:** Serving the static React application.  
  * **Firestore:** Storing site data and user information (as per firestore.rules).  
  * **Cloud Functions:** For potential server-side logic (as per /functions directory).

## **🚀 Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

* **npm**  
  `npm install`
  `npm insatll firebase`

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   `git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/ChronoVision.git\](https://github.com/your-username/ChronoVision.git)  
   cd ChronoVision`

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**  
   `cd frontend`

3. **Install NPM packages:**  
   `npm install`

4. **Set up Firebase:**  
   * Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
   * In your new Firebase project, create a new Web App.  
   * You will be given a firebaseConfig object. Copy this object.  
   * Replace the placeholder configuration in frontend/src/firebase/config.ts with your own project's configuration.

*For best practice, it is recommended to move these keys into a .env.local file at the root of the /frontend directory and access them using import.meta.env.VITE\_API\_KEY.*

5. **Run the development server:**  
   `npm run dev`

   Your application should now be running on http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## **📂 Project Structure**

The repository is organized as a monorepo with the frontend application and Firebase backend configurations in separate directories.
